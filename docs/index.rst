Welcome to the Stormpath Python SDK's Documentation!
====================================================

The Stormpath Python SDK allows any Python based application to easily use the
Stormpath user management service for all authentication and access control needs.

This documentation will walk you through everything you need to know to start
using Stormpath in your Python application!

If you'd like to view our more comprehensive Python guide (which walks through
every possible use case), you should probably check out the official
`Python SDK Product Guide <http://docs.stormpath.com/python/product-guide/>`_.
